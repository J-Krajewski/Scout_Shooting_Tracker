In the UK, various target types are used for air rifle shooting, including:

    Paper targets: These are typically sheets of paper with scoring rings or bullseyes printed on them. They are commonly used for precision shooting practice.

    Knockdown targets: These are usually metal targets that are designed to fall down when hit. They can vary in shape and size and are often used in competitions or recreational shooting.

    Spinner targets: These are targets that have a metal spinner attached to them. When the target is hit, the spinner rotates, providing immediate feedback to the shooter.

    Reactive targets: These targets are designed to react in some way when hit, such as swinging or moving. They can be made of various materials, including metal or rubber.

    Silhouette targets: These targets typically depict the outline of various animals or objects and are used to simulate hunting scenarios. They can be made of paper, metal, or other materials.

    Field targets: These are specialized targets used in field target shooting competitions. They often consist of metal knockdown targets placed at various distances and heights within a natural environment.
